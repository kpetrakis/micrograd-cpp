### micrograd in C++

I try to implement karpathy's micrograd in C++ for practice!

#### TODO:
- add functionality in "dunder methods" like in the original implementation
 if isistance(other, value):
	 Maybe use templates in every operator overloading?? so that i have a single function for every operation! 

- I HAVE TO IMPLEMENT +=, *+ !!!
